Suggested JSON Schema validators
================================

The following links are third-party online JSON Schema validators:

<http://jsonschemalint.com/#/version/draft-04/markup/json>

<http://json-schema-validator.herokuapp.com>

<http://www.jsonschemavalidator.net>

Copy-paste jliff-schema-V.json and the example(s) for online validation.

TODO
====

- JLIFF JSON Schema constraints review requested.
- Perhaps add `"additionalProperties: false` to each JSON object type that is defined to restrict the properties to only those that may appear.
- More examples with comparable XLIFF 2.0 examples.
